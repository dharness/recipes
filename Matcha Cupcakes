1 2/3  cup  all-purpose flour  215g
2 tbsp ceremonial matcha powder
1  cups  granulated sugar  200g
1/4  tsp  baking soda 1g, heaping
1  tsp  baking powder 4g, heaping
1/4  tsp  kosher salt 1g, heaping
3/4  cup  unsalted butter 190g, room temperature
3  eggs room temperature
2  tsp  vanilla extract 5mL
3/4 cup buttermilk 177mL

Notes:
Makes 16, but they are a little small
deflated after removal - possibly due to alkaline nature of the matcha? Consider adding cream of tartar to compensate?
We also opened the oven 3 times to check and rotate them - so maybe that contributed too.
